Introduction:
-------------
This project is my attempt to combine two things I enjoy: exploring data and understanding the trends of real-world decisions. Starbucks is an iconic brand, and I wanted to dive into its operations to discover insights to arrive at meaningful outcomes.
The Starbucks Analytics Dashboard is an interactive tool I built to analyze customer behaviors, menu offerings, and store locations. 
It’s a showcase of what data can reveal and how it can be used to make better decisions.

Why This Project?
-----------------
As someone exploring the field of data analytics, I wanted to challenge myself with a project that’s both insightful and practical. Starbucks provides a wealth of publicly available data (Kaggle) on its menu, store locations, and customer offers, making it a great use case to:
1. Understand customer preferences and behaviors.
2. Analyze menu trends to suggest improvements.
3. Explore global store locations and identify expansion opportunities.
This project wasn’t just about building a dashboard—it was about learning and applying analytics in a way that matters.

Tools Used:
-----------
1. Python: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
2. Dash and Plotly: To create interactive visualizations.
3. Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
4. Render: For deployment to make the dashboard accessible online.
